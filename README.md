# Home for Technigo Coders

This is my final project for Technigo â€“ a community forum app where students can log in, ask coding questions, and help each other out.

## The problem

Technigo students often face challenges while learning to code and sometimes need quick support. To solve this, I created a simple forum app with authentication and discussion features.

Approach & Tools:

Planned with wireframes and user journeys in Figma

Built the frontend with React, React Router, Zustand, and Material UI for styling

Built the backend with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (Mongoose)

Implemented authentication with JWT + bcrypt

Deployed both frontend and backend for real usage

Add post categories/tags

#Tech Stack

Frontend: React, React Router, Zustand, Material UI, TailwindCSS
Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB (Mongoose)
Other: JWT, bcrypt, dotenv, Axios
